                    <h1>Killer Side</h1>
                    
                    <p>Killer have objective to kill all survivor in the match and prevent survivors to complete the gens. Killer must find survivor and if you find the survivor you will attack him/her.
                        Survivor will injured if killer manage to land a hit at survivor. Then, killer must hit once again to down survivor. Now, killer must carry survivor to the hook and hooked him/her.
                        There are 3 phase while survivor get hooked. First The summon, it will summon The entity to devours survivor(survivor can get attempt to free themselves, if they fail
                        The entity summoning will speed up). Second phase is Struggle phase, Survivor must fight the entity by pressing the button rapidly. The final phase is the 
                        survivor died because The entity devours him/her. Each killer have different abilities and perks.For example the doctor(this is my favourite :))
                        He can shock the survivor and survivors will scream loudly while revealing they location. If they get shock they will get a madness and if the madness 
                        get to tier 3 the survivor can't repair the generator or heal. The doctor perks called monitor&abuse, overcharge and Overwhelming Presence.
                        Monitor&abuse will decrease terror radius and increase it while on the chase(when the killer chase survivor).
                        Overcharge will trigger generator skill check if the killer kick the generator.
                        Overwhelming Presence will increase item consumption rate if the survivor in killer terror radius and bring an item.

                    <h1>Survivor Side</h1>
                    
                    <p>Survivor have objective to repair gens and escape from the match(don't dc or you will get banned).Survivor will get a skill check while they repairing gen
                      Survivor can't heal themselves(if you don't bring a perk called "self care"), the other survivor can heal the person who get injured.
                      When survivor get hooked from first and second phase, the other survivor will trying to save him/her. While in the chase, survivor can rely
                      on pallet. Pallet will stun the killer and survivor can get enough time to get away from the killer. The other option is to loop the killer around
                      the map. Survivor can bring an item(flashlight, key, fireworks or toolbox). Each item has different purpose and advantage. Flashlight can blind
                      the killer(the killer screen will get a picture like if your eyes get a huge amount of light and it will blind you for a second).
                      Key can open the hatch(hatch will spawn when there is a single survivor left or all generator has been repaired). Fireworks can blind the killer, but 
                      it's only single use. Toolbox can repair the gens faster or sabotage the hooked(the hooked will broken and killer must go to another hook).
